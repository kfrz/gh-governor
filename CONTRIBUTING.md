### Style & Conventions 

#### Commit Messages 

This project is configured to generate changelogs using [git-chglog](https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog). To ensure changelogs are generated correctly, please follow the commit message guidelines below.

* All commits must be signed. To sign commits, run `git config --global commit.gpgsign true` and ensure you have a GPG key configured. For more information on signing commits, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits).

* Commit content should follow Conventional Commit guidelines. See [conventionalcommits.org](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for more information. In general, commit messages should be structured as follows:

    ```
    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer(s)]
    ```
* Types include: 
            `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`.
* Keep commits focused and atomic, and use the body to provide additional context. If a commit closes an issue, include `Closes #<issue number>` in the footer.

#### pre-commit

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` is included to help with linting and formatting. To install the pre-commit hooks, ensure you have [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) installed then run:

```sh
pre-commit install
# or, selectively install hook types
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

### Architectural Decisions

- The goal of gh-governor is to be lightweight and safe.
- gh-governor should be able to be run in a dry-run mode to preview changes.
- Any major changes should be discussed in an issue before being implemented.

### Code of Conduct

Be kind.
